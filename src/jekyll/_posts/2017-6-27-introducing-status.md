excerpt: Status pages are an effective way to inform to your website users whether a specific website system is operational or not. Find out how you can use a status page to inform timely and informative updates to your users. Start building one with an open-source status page generator. Read my blog to learn more.

## Almost all websites all over the web ecosystem have their own status pages. Websites like [GitHub](https://github.com) have their own status pages. So what is exactly a status page? 

A status page contains specific details of the status of a website system whether they are operational or not. It provides an ease in informing website visitors about specific system status like site maintenance, design, APIs and CDNs. Instead of replying to the entire organization when the site goes down, the website can have an opt-in to every status update. A status page informs a visitor in detail about specific downtime incidents. It includes a list of the status of each individual functional unit of your site &mdash; so if one function of a site is down but all of the other parts are working, this can be indicated on the status page and to provide a detail of what exactly whatâ€™s going on.

My status page is created using an open-source project, [Statuspage](https://github.com/jayfk/statuspage) by [Jannis Gebauer](https://github.com/jayfk). My status page includes five main site functionalities namely, API, Blog, CDN, Design, and Website. Below are the detailed descriptions of each functional units/systems of the site:
- APIs - The application program interface (API) functional unit includes status of the APIs that were used and that are available in the website. Whenever there are incidents and maintenance work to be done, this section must display the specific issue that is currently investigated.
- Blog - This functional unit is the system status of [this blog site](https://blog.marcreyes.ph). Whenever a problem or an issue arises and needs to be investigated, this section must display the specific issue that is currently investigated.
- CDN - The content delivery network (CDN) functional unit includes status of the CDN that is used in this site. If some contents of the whole marcreyes.ph is not delivered to a specific geographic location or if there are maintenance work to be done, this section must display the specific issue that is currently investigated.
- Design - This functional unit includes the design aspect of all websites of the system, specifically site responsiveness, content display of the website, as well as the interface implementation of the system. There will always be maintenance work in terms of design so this section must include the specific issue that is currently investigated.
- Website - This functional unit is the status of the [main page site](https://www.marcreyes.ph). Most of the time, most of the content of the main page is maintained and if problem or an issue arises and needs to be investigated, this section must display the specific issue that is currently investigated. ![Status Incidents](/assets/images/status-incident-thumbnail.jpg "Status Incidents")

On the status page, there is an Incident section. The incident section shows the specific issue that is being investigated, as well as the time and the functional unit/system that is/are affected. If the issue has been resolved, this section must show an update of the issue being investigated.
