## More About Me

I'm Marc and I love data. I'm currently working as a Machine Learning engineer at [Mynt](https://mynt.xyz/), a fintech company in Taguig, Philippines. Before I was introduced to the world of Machine Learning and Data Science, I was designing websites and user interfaces for school activities and freelance work. Pursuing a career in Machine Learning and Data Science was not something I put a lot of thought into in the past, but things turned around when I joined my first TensorFlow Dev Summit Extended in Cagayan de Oro, and well, the rest was history. Since then, I have been speaking at tech conferences and involved myself in community development projects with Machine Learning.
