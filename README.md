# Marc Reyes - Software Engineer

I'm Marc Reyes, a Software Engineer focused on Web Development, DevOps, and Data Science from the Philippines.

## About
I’m Marc and I love data. I’m currently working as a Machine Learning engineer at [Mynt](https://mynt.xyz/), a fintech company in Taguig, Philippines. Before I was introduced to the world of Machine Learning and Data Science, I was designing websites and user interfaces for school activities and freelance work. Pursuing a career in Machine Learning and Data Science was not something I put a lot of thought into in the past, but things turned around when I joined my first TensorFlow Dev Summit Extended in Cagayan de Oro, and well, the rest was history. Since then, I have been speaking at tech conferences and involved myself in community development projects with Machine Learning.

## Usage

You'll need to have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the `bundler` gem, and [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) (`npm` also works) installed on our computer. Autumn provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup — just clone and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Ruby gems
bundle install
# Node modules
yarn
```
Then simply run `yarn start` to start the Jekyll server on port `4000`.

## Options

Autumn includes some customizable options, applied via options in the `_config.yml` file. A standout feature is the dark theme.
Have a look at the [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) file for all available options.
