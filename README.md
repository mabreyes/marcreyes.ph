# Marc Reyes CV

Hi! My name is Marc and I'm a developer from Cagayan de Oro, Philippines, and building interfaces and developing Machine Learning and AI applications for various causes are some of my skills as an up-and-coming developer. I'm also occasionally invited to speak at tech conferences to share my knowledge and experiences as a budding front-end-web-developer-turned-data-scientist.
