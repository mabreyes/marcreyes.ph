# Marc Reyes Blog

### A blog website by Marc Reyes

Marc X is a dev + design start-up by [Marc Reyes](https://www.facebook.com/marcreyesph). Started in 2013, the start-up aims to provide cheaper web development and design alternatives for students and professionals.

Site is proudly hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/marcreyesph/marcreyesph.github.io/) and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Setup

If you don't have `npm` and `gulp` installed in your system then you need to install them first before running. 

Install `npm`: Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm. However, npm gets updated more frequently than Node does, so you'll want to make sure it's the latest version. 

Install `gulp`:  ```npm install --g gulp```

### Deployment
```bash
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:/marcreyesph/marcreyesph.github.io
$ cd marcreyesph.github.io
$ npm install
$ gulp default
```
