Building software, automating processes, and making data-driven decisions is what I enjoy most about my work. Currently working at <a class="link-1" href="https://gcash.com" target="_blank">GCash</a> as a Machine Learning Engineer.

Iâ€™m <a class="link-1" href="https://twitter.com/marcreyesph" target="_blank">tweeting</a>, taking <a class="link-1" href="https://www.instagram.com/marcxplanet" target="_blank">photos</a>, and pushing my <a class="link-1" href="https://github.com/mabreyes" target="_blank">codes</a> for the world to see.
